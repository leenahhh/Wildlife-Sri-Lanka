      <H2 class="pg1heading">A Guide To The Wildlife Of Sri Lanka</H2><br>
      <p class="page1p">The island of Sri Lanka is home to a diverse array of wildlife, including elephants, leopards, marine life,
        and a wide variety of birds. It is also one of the best places in the world to witness whales, notably the majestic blue whale.</p><br>
        <p>The easiest method to see animals in their natural habitat is to visit safari parks and sanctuaries, especially in the southern
        and central regions of the country, where 12% of the land is set aside for wildlife conservation.</p><br>
        <p>Keep an eye out for sightings of the endangered leopard; observe the elephants at their feeding and washing stations in tanks
        or lagoons; or take a leisurely stroll along the west and south coast beaches close to the marine turtles as they lay their eggs.

      <p>The island nation of Sri Lanka, which is tucked away in the Indian Ocean, is a secret haven for avian enthusiasts.
        An astounding variety of bird species find home in Sri Lanka, which has a broad range of environments from lush rainforests to barren plains.
        It is a birdwatcher's heaven due to its tropical temperature, immaculate scenery, and friendly residents.
        A Refuge for Bird Diversity.<br><br>
        The surprising variety of birds seen in Sri Lanka is hidden by its small size. For both experienced and inexperienced birdwatchers,
        there are over 440 documented bird species. The island provides a unique opportunity to study resident and seasonal species,
        since it acts as a crossroads for migratory birds.
      </p>
  
      <p>There are numerous Important Bird Areas and bird sanctuaries in the area where a remarkable variety of avifauna can be observed.<br><br> The Kumana and Bundala
        National Parks are excellent places to go bird watching, offering views of nearly all Sri Lankan bird species.
        Another popular destination in Sri Lanka is the Sinharaja Bird Wave, which offers tourists the island's longest and 
        greatest documented bird waves.</p>
        
      <p>Sri Lanka is a birdwatcher's dream come true, with five RAMSAR locations.<br><br> The southern region of Bundala is primarily
        made up of brackish water lagoons and is well-known for its vast migratory flamingo flocks.Kumana National Park, which is 
        located in the same region, provides a nice mix of woodland and marsh areas and was one of the first bird sanctuaries
        in the nation. Here's your chance to see the bashful Southern Sirkeer, hopefully.<br><br> In a similar vein, the Anawilundawa Wetlands
        in the northwest are made up of a network of tanks that serve as a haven for a variety of duck and wader species.
        The Sinharaja Rainforest is home to twenty of Sri Lanka's twenty-six rare bird species. Among these are the stunning Blue Magpie,
        Green-billed Coucal, and Red-faced Malkoha.

      <p class="page1p-2">On the island, 102 terrestrial animals have been found thus far. Of these, 90 are native species, 14 of which are unique to Sri Lanka.
        Because of the island's varied temperature, vegetation, attitude, and geographic past, mammals are widely dispersed throughout the nation.<br><br>
        Elephants are the most iconic animal on the island, and many visitors come to Sri Lanka just to view them. To observe elephants in 
        their natural habitat in one of the national parks, or to learn more about the significance of elephants to Sri Lankan culture,
        stop by the Millenium Elephant Foundation.<br><br> Many national parks in Sri Lanka offer opportunities to witness the elusive leopard,
        but Yala National Park boasts the largest density of leopards worldwide. Visit the serene Wilpattu to observe sloth bears, 
        or visit the Polonnaruwa monkeys to witness toque macaque, grey langur, and purple-faced leaf monkeys.<br><br>

      it heads back out to sea. How about taking a wildlife vacation in Sri Lanka?<br><br> There are wildlife activities all year round on the
      island because of its remarkably diverse topography and the amazing array of species that have made this their home.
