      <p>With a total area of 130,000 hectares, Wilpattu is the largest national park in Sri Lanka. It is also the oldest, having reopened
        after being closed for several years due to the country's armed conflict. A few decades ago, Wilpattu's leopard population made 
        it more well-known than Yala's. One distinctive aspect of Wilpattu is the park's large, sand-rimmed natural lakes, or "Villus,"
         which collect rainwater and draw wildlife, particularly during dry spells.

          <p>Sri Lanka is renowned for being among the top destinations in the world for the best animal attractions. Because of the Wilpattu 
            National Park's size and soil, it has developed into one of the best places to see wildlife. Elephants from Sri Lanka, sloth bears, spotted deer, 
            water buffaloes, and langurs all call it home. It is home to the Sri Lankan leopard, a species that draws a lot of tourists.
            The Sri Lankan leopard is the dominant feline species in Sri Lanka and the most elusive in the world. Leopards in Sri Lanka 
            are more laid-back than they are anyplace else in the world, because there are no lions or tigers to endanger their status.
            They are frequently observed lounging in the treetops.</p>

          <h1 id="location">AREA AND LOCATION</h1><br>
          <p>On Sri Lanka's northwest coast, inland, Wilpattu is situated roughly 185 km north of Colombo and 26 km north of Puttalam. It extends 
            in the direction of Anuradhapura, the former capital. At 131, 693 hectares, the park is the largest national park in Sri Lanka, 
            spanning the border between the North Central and North Western Provinces! The park's west boundary is 35 kilometers long and runs 
            along Sri Lanka's northwest coast. Wilpattu became a National Park on February 25, 1938, after being designated as a wildlife refuge 
            in 1905. Two major rivers border Wilpattu from the north and south: the Modara Gamaru to the north of the park and the Kala Oya to 
            the south.
