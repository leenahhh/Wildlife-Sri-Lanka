        <h1>Wilpattu National Park</h1><br>
        <p>Stretching across more than 131 thousand hectares, this protected area is the largest and oldest in Sri Lanka.<br><br> The Department of Wildlife Conservation
          oversees the five blocks that make up the park, which was established between 1938 and 1973 in accordance with the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance.
          WNP borders the districts of Mannar and Vavuniya and extends over Puttalam and Anuradhapura.<br><br>In addition to being one of the most significant habitats for 
          elephants in the nation, the location is excellent for seeing sloth bears and Sri Lankan leopards.
          Compared to many other Sri Lankan national parks, it has a denser forest cover.<br><br> The scenery of the WNPs is made up of sand dunes, vast open plains,
          distinctive Villu wetlands, and dry zone woods and prickly scrub. The bare reddish cliffs that rise sharply from the slender beaches of the Dutch Bay
          and Portugal Bay are another remarkable aspect of the area.</p><br>

          <h1>Yala National Park</h1><br>
          <p>Shaggy undergrowth and monsoon woods predominate in Yala, which is situated in the island's arid zone. <br><br>The reserve is primarily level,
            but it is broken up by large granite outcrops, meadows, and brackish lakes. Sand dunes define the reserve's coastline edge.<br><br> The park receives
            rainfall from the northeast monsoon and is located in the island's semi-arid zone.</p><br>

          <h1>Excessive Huntings</h1><br>
          <p>Poachers occasionally target leopards for the illegal wildlife market trading of their skin, bones, and other body parts.
            This illicit activity is a serious danger to Sri Lankan leopard populations.<br><br>

            risks rising for 1,000 left</a><br><br>
            The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has designated the Sri Lankan leopard, a native subspecies of leopards, as endangered. 
            There are only about 1000 leopards in the world, and poaching is one of the many factors contributing to their diminishing population. 
            These days, the population is restricted to those parts of the nation that respect the preservation of these animals.<br><br>
            Since 1964, the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance has provided protection for Sri Lankan leopards. Leopards are now classified as 
            "strictly protected species" under the 2009 modification to the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance.<br><br> This means that it is illegal to kill,
            maim, or hurt a leopard, or to keep a live animal, a dead body, or any part of a body. Selling or exposing a dead body or any part of one,
            as well as dealing in live animals, are prohibited when it comes to leopards.<br><br> The use of any tool, material, or device to carry out any of 
            these offenses is included in the offenses. Additionally, each of these offenses is considered a cognisable offense, meaning that an arrest 
            warrant is not necessary to apprehend the perpetrator. Regular research is also conducted to improve Sri Lankan leopard conservation efforts.<br><br>

            <h1>Loss of Habitat</h1><br>
            <p>The loss of habitat brought on by human activities like deforestation, urbanization, and agricultural development is one of the 
              main dangers facing leopards in Sri Lanka. There is less room for leopards to wander and find food as human populations increase and encroach upon
              natural areas. This causes conflicts with humans and a fall in leopard population.<br><br>
              Wild animals are forced into increasingly constrained areas as a result of ad hoc initiatives that are started, frequently at the request of local politicians,
              and the destruction of forests and natural habitat.<br><br> They invade cultivations that were formerly their home areas since they are unable to thrive on the 
              food that is there, and their demise is certain. The prey species of leopards migrate towards humans first, attracted by the nutrient-rich cultivations 
              and with little remaining in their current confinement regions. The local population hunts them down, making them the main targets of snares and traps.<br><br>
              Following them is inevitable, and once they do, the leopards find domestic animals simpler to kill than their more cunning wild cousins due to their 
              diminished survival instincts. <br><br>
              It is a blessing that so many non-governmental organizations, academic institutions, and even concerned individuals put up so much effort to preserve what 
              is left. This frequently entails raising the money required to take a project through to completionâ€”money that ought to be given by the appropriate institution
              but is instead spent on pointless activities.<br><br>
              The first Multi-Regional Monitoring System for the Conservation of the Sri Lanka Leopard was introduced in the nation in 2021 by the WNPS and LOLC.
              Six research stations were first established in Kotagala, Sinharaja, Panama, Kilinochchi, Belihul Oya, and Sigiriya. The research will monitor the presence of 
              leopards using video traps and surveys. <br><br>
              Along with acting as information hubs for the local community, the research centers will communicate with the DWC and Forest Officers and develop research-based
              strategies for mitigating human-leopard conflicts. In order to combat the rising number of leopard deaths in Sri Lanka, this is essential.<br><br>
              Another such endeavor is the launch of much-needed awareness campaigns by Unilevers and the Rainforest Alliance in the upcountry plantation areas where the
              number of human-leopard conflicts has rapidly increased.<br><br>
